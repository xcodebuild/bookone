# Image

Bookone provide some features for image in book writing.

## Image Title

Use first argument in image markup to display a title for image. And image with title will have index like `Figure 1-2`ï¼Œ it's ordered within Chapter.

```markdown
![image alt](../public/images/safari.png "Image Title")
```

![image alt](../public/images/safari.png#safari "Image Title")

## Cite Image
You can give id to image with `#` in url.

```markdown
![image alt](../../doc/public/images/safari.png#safari "Image Title")
```

Then cite them with

```markdown
[](#safari)
```

It will be rendered as image index like `1-2`.

![image alt](https://i.postimg.cc/0zQTZkZx/5436704-50.png#xcodebuild "xcodebuild")

For example this is a reference for above `Image Title` image: Figure [](#safari)

And this is a reference for `xcodebuild` image: Figure [](#xcodebuild)

> Tip: Index for image would be miss in `start` mode at the moment, but it should works well in `build` mode.
